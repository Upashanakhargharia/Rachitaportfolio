                <h2>Starting a Movement</h2>
                <p>
                  Girl Power Talk was founded on the idea that young India needs
                  an innovative new work culture that equally harnesses peopleâ€™s
                  talents, irrespective of their gender. Girl Power Talk is more
                  than a company. We are a movement rooted in empowerment,
                  professional ambition, and social impact. For generations,
                  women have been relegated to secondary roles, and the youth
                  exploited for their energy and inexperience. We are a culture
                  that will make history by changing this dynamic and writing
                  the beautiful next chapter in this story.
